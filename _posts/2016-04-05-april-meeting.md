## Meeting Tuesday on April 5th.

The April meeting is today.
We will watch part of a video of Alan Kay's Keynote at OOPSLA 1997,
_The computer revolution hasnt happened yet_.

The full talk is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY
).

We will watch a few of these seminal talks over the summer. Let me know if
there's a particular one that you think we should all watch and discuss together.

Check out the [About](/about) page for time and place.
