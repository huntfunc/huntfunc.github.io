## Meeting this week on January 5th.

The January meeting is today.

Our meeting today will be an informal show-n-tell.
Bring some code you'd like get feedback on or just want to show what you've been working on.

As time permits, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the functional state of the art for the
area and what we can do in 2016 to improve that.

Check out the [About](/about) page for time and place.

### 2016 Possibilities

* __[Julia](http://julialang.org)__ with Craig Bosma

Let me know if you would like to give a talk.
