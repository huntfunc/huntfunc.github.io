Welcome Jason Steinhauser as the new HuntFunc organizer!

As you can probably guess from the lastest posts on the mailing list, we have a new organizer.

It's no secret that my ability to organize, motivate, and do whatever else
user group organizers should do, has lately fallen into virtual [nothingness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer).

I has been a fun run but it is time to turn this over to someone else.

Hope to see you at a meeting soon.

Bret
